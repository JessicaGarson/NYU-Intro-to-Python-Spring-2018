I am a librarian at NYU.

## Motivation for Being Part of the Class
I want to be able to more effectively manage metadata at work and stay ahead in my field.

## Area of Interest
I think  I'll eventually be working mainly with a module called pyMARC which assists in editing large amounts of bibliographic data for library systems. I hope to find some personal areas of interests aside from utilizing code at work.

##Fun Facts
I grew up in NYC, my interests/hobbies include 80's heavy metal, guitar, board games, science fiction, and meditation. 

##Favorite Movie
Finding Forrester, Short Circuit 2... I'm not really a movie person
