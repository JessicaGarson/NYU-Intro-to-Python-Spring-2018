I am a librarian at NYU.
## Motivation for Being Part of the Class
I want to be able to more effectively manage metadata at work and stay ahead in my field.

## Area of Interest
I think eventually I'll be working mainly with a module called pyMARC which assists in editiing and large amounts of bibliographic data for library systems. I hope to find some personal areas of interests aside from utilizing code at work.
