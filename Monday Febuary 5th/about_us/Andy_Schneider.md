Hi! I'm originally from California, but have been living in New York for going on seven years. I like dogs and rock climbing.

# Motivation for Being Part of the Class
I have seen the power of programming, especially in Python, and feel like I am a bit belated in joining the party. I've seen how one can basically explore, analyze, and visualize data in a way that feels like writing.

# Area of Interest
I am mainly interested in data wrangling and modeling. I want to be able to pull data, clean it up, explore it, and set up some models in order to forecast and predict. 

# Fun Facts 
I hate bagel bites. Just kidding, who hates bagel bites?

# Favorite Movie 
Wet Hot American Summer

# Dream Project 
Managing the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's campaign.
