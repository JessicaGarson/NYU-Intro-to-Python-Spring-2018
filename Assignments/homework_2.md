# Homework 2
## Make HTML Tags

The web is built with HTML strings like "<i>Yay</i>" which draws Yay as italic text. In this example, the "i" tag makes <i> and </i> which surround the word "Yay". Given tag and word strings, create the HTML string with tags around the word, e.g. "<i>Yay</i>".

Create a function called make_tags, that will give you a string with tags around it.

The function you write should give you the following outputs:
make_tags('i', 'Yay') will yield '<i>Yay</i>'
make_tags('i', 'Hello') will yield '<i>Hello</i>'
make_tags('cite', 'Yay') will yield '<cite>Yay</cite>'
