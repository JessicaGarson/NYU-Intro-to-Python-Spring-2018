## Problem 1 - Dictionaries
Inside of a Jupyter notebook create a dictionary with a one sentence definition of  all the concepts we covered.

Use a loop to create an output that looks something like this:

```
Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs.

String: A series of characters.

Boolean Expression: An expression that evaluates to True or False.

Comment: A note in a program that the Python interpreter ignores.

Value: An item associated with a key in a dictionary.

Loop: Work through a collection of items, one at a time.

List: A collection of items in a particular order.

Key: The first item in a key-value pair in a dictionary.

Float: A numerical value with a decimal component.
```

## Problem 2 - Sets
Create 2 sets one of your favorite movies and one of another person in your life's favorite movies.

- What favorite movies do you have in common with the other person?

- What movies are your favorite but aren't the other persons?

## Problem 3 - Tuples
Create a tuple of many of the major tasks you have to complete for the day in the order you have to complete them. So for example the tasks for me are as follows:

- wake up
- eat breakfast
- go to work
- eat lunch
- leave work
- go the gym
- eat dinner
- read
- sleep

Create a program that goes through this tuple and tells the story of a typical day for you.
