# Peanut Butter Jelly Time

Today we're going to make some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches using functions.

You need three ingredients to make a PB&J, so you'll want three different variables:
- How much bread do you have? (make this a number that reflects how many slices of bread you have)
- Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread
- How much peanut butter do you have? (make this a number that reflects how many sandwiches-worth of peanut butter you have)
- How much jelly do you have? (make this a number that reflects how many sandwiches-worth of jelly you have)

## Part 1
You will ask the user how much of each they have.

## Part 2
How many full sandwiches do you have the resources to make?

## Part 3
If there is leftover bread let the user know they can make an open faced sandwich with the leftover slice.
