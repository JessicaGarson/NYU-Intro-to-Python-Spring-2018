# Object Oriented Python
So what is object oriented programming? Object oriented programming allows us to have reusable patterns of code. We do this so we can repeat ourselves less.

If our code is less repetitive, it is more readable and thus easier to maintain.

This is opposed to procedural programming which is where we have a set of instructions to follow. Older programming languages such as COBAL focus on this type programming. Object oriented programming focuses more on logic than specific instructions.

## But wait, I heard about functional programming what's that?
You may have heard of a different paradigm called functional programming and might be wondering what the difference is between that and object oriented programming.
[Here is a great article from CodeNewbie that explains the difference between the two](https://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/object-oriented-programming-vs-functional-programming).

## Classes and objects
The two core concepts of object oriented programming are classes and objects.

Classes - a blueprint of an object. Think of this as a blueprint of a house that's about to be built.

Objects - an instance of a class.

## This looks similar to functions
We have been working with functions for about a month now, we are building off of this concept.

## Classes
Everything we put inside a class is something that is common to a group of things.
```python
class Cars:
    def driving(self):
        print('driving down the road, singing to the radio')

    def gas(self):
        print('at the gas station getting gas')
```
