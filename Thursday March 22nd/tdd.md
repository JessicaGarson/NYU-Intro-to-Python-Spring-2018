# TDD activity
The best way to learn TDD is to try out yourself.

## Step 1
Should be run on the command line. Avoid using raw input. Strings and math are a good way to get started.
Try to solve this problem:

Write a function, calculateTip(amount, rating) which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service.

You need to consider the following ratings:

Terrible: tip 0%
Poor: tip 5%
Good: tip 10%
Great: tip 15%
Excellent: tip 20%

## Step 2
Figure out what the outcomes will be.

## Step 3
Write the tests. Check out the resources section if you get stuck here.

## Step 4
Run the tests. These should fail.

## Step 5
Now write the code you will need for these tests to be successful.

## Step 6
Did your tests pass? Yay skip to step 7.

## Step 7
Refactor your code to make your tests pass.

## Step 8
Play around. What happens if you make changes to your code? Do your tests always pass? Maybe try to make them fail.
