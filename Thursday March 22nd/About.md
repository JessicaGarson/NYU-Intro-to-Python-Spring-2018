# Thursday March 22nd
Today we're going to finish up introducing object oriented programming and than getting started writing tests for our code. Testing is a pretty cool implementation of OOP.

## Continuing with Objected Oriented Programming
We will be covering the following:
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Testing
We're going to dive into testing from there. Since testing relies heavily on using classes.
- What is testing?
- Let's finish some tests
- Let's write a simple program with the tests first.

## Games due Monday
The text based games are due Monday. Can't wait to see what you build.
