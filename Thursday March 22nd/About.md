# Thursday March 22nd
Today we're going to finish up introducing object oriented programming and than getting started writing tests for our code. Testing is a pretty cool implementation of OOP.

[Slides are here](http://jessicagarson.com/NYU-Intro-to-Python-March-22/#/)

## Continuing with Objected Oriented Programming
We will be covering the following:
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Testing
We're going to dive into testing from there. Since testing relies heavily on using classes.
- What is testing?
- Let's finish some tests
- Let's write a simple program with the tests first.

## Games due Monday
The text based games are due Monday. Can't wait to see what you build.

## Office Hours
I'm available for office hours. The times I'm around are as follows:
- Tomorrow from 8:30 - 9:30am and after 5:30, all day Saturday, Sunday, or Monday.

Virtual seemed to work pretty well with one student so email me to schedule.

## Agenda
### 6:30 - 7:00
Inheritance
### 7:00 - 7:20
Polymorphism
### 7:20 - 8:00
Testing

## Next class
Our last class together :(

We'll be starting by playing each others games. And doing a workshop with a guest speaker on APIs! Followed by some parting thoughts about what's happening next and how to continue learning. We'll likely go out for drinks after so if you have ideas on where to go shoot me an email.

## Resources on APIs
- [Fall 2014 hackNY Hackathon - API 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkWW999zfeE)
