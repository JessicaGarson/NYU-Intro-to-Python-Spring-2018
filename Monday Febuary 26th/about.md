# Monday February 26th
Today we're going to get started with the data structure lists. After we feel good about lists we're going to dive into loops, which allows us to be insanely productive.

Slides are found [here](http://jessicagarson.com/NYU-Intro-to-Python-Feb-26/).

## Homework Show and Tell
We'll get started with reviewing our homework! Break up into groups of 5 - 6 and go around and discuss how you solved the homework assignment.

## How to Prepare for the Next Class
We are going to start out by going over everything we have covered in class thus far and work on problems from HackerRank in pairs. We will end class with a lecture on debugging hard problems.
