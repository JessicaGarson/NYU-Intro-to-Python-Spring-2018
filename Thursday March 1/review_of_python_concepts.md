# Review of Python Concepts Covered
We've been moving pretty quickly as a class so far. So let's take a step back and think about everything we've learned so far.

## Variables
- They are containers of information
- Variables are names that you can assign values to 
- Variables can contain numbers, strings, lists, True/False, or any type of information you want to store
- Variable names can contain letters and underscores and should be descriptive (can you tell what it's used for?)

## Strings
- Strings (text) can contain anything that you can type out on the keyboard 
- Strings are commonly used for names, phone numbers, email addresses, other addresses, URLs, and so much more! 
- Slicing is used to see parts of a string
- String methods allow you to do special actions on strings (find, replace, count, lowercase, etc)
- .format() is the string method we'll use most often.

## Conditionals
- Conditionals allow you to change the behavior of your program.
- Program behavior is based on your variables.
```
if condition:
    do something
elif other_condition:
    do something else
else:
    do another thing
```

## Functions
- We can write our own functions which are bits of reusable code.
- Functions a def statement that allows us to define our function, a body of our code we can write our code in it and a return value - that gives us a value to save.
- Functions take in parameters/arguments. Parameters are the variables inside the function. Arguments are the value passed into the function.
- Variables saved inside of a function are local to that function.
- Variables that aren't inside of a function or are called global can be used throughout the entire program.

## Activity
Write down one thing you have learned so far. Share it with a partner.
