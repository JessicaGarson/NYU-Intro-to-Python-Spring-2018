# Review of Python Concepts Covered
We've been moving pretty quickly as a class so far. So let's take a step back and think about everything we've learned so far.

## Variables
- They are containers of information
- Variables are names that you can assign values to 
- Variables can contain numbers, strings, lists, True/False, or any type of information you want to store
- Variable names can contain letters and underscores and should be descriptive (can you tell what it's used for?)

## Strings
- Strings (text) can contain anything that you can type out on the keyboard 
- Strings are commonly used for names, phone numbers, email addresses, other addresses, URLs, and so much more! 
- Slicing is used to see parts of a string
- String methods allow you to do special actions on strings (find, replace, count, lowercase, etc)
- .format() is the string method we'll use most often.

## Integers
Numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, or 1341

## Floats
Floating point numbers like 3.14, 3423.2342, 32.34

## Conditionals
- Conditionals allow you to change the behavior of your program.
- Program behavior is based on your variables.
```
if condition:
    do something
elif other_condition:
    do something else
else:
    do another thing
```

## Functions
- We can write our own functions which are bits of reusable code.
- Functions a def statement that allows us to define our function, a body of our code we can write our code in it and a return value - that gives us a value to save.
- Functions take in parameters/arguments. Parameters are the variables inside the function. Arguments are the value passed into the function.
- Variables saved inside of a function are local to that function.
- Variables that aren't inside of a function or are called global can be used throughout the entire program.

## Lists
- Lists are containers that can hold multiple pieces of information.
- Lists are commonly used to hold strings (ex: list of attendees’ names) or numbers (ex: number of attendees for each class)
- Lists are a data structure that allows us to hold multiple values.
- Lists are are created by placing items inside of [ ] 
- They are comma separated

## Loops
- Using loops we can automate and repeat tasks in a very short amount of time.
- A for loop lets you use each item one at a time, which is great for performing actions a certain number of times.
- While loops are the cousins of conditionals.
- While loops are repeating conditional statements. After an if statement, the program continues to execute code, but in a while loop, the program jumps back to the start of the while statement until the condition is False. Think about Jess and Hamid and the chalk.

## Activity
Write down one thing you have learned so far. Share it with a partner.
