## Create a file
In a jupyter notebook, create a file with a message you want to say.

## Create your dataset
In excel or google sheets create a data set with the  headers: names, number of pets. Ask your partner and 5 other students for how many pets they have.

Save this file as 'students_pets.csv' and move it into the directory where you are running your jupyter notebook.

## Load this dataset into pandas
Let me know the average number of pets for the dataset you have.

Hint:
```python
df['num_of_pets'].mean()
```

## Take a look at the descriptive statistics for your dataset
Let's take a look at the stats for it.
